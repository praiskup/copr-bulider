To have 1:1 replacement with current backend->builder build mechanism, we need
to have those fixed:

    - collect mock configuration into resultdir/configs so copr backend knows
      where to download them
    - add support for custom mock configs
    - implement opt-out/in "Other options" from "New Build" form:
        - Enable internet access during this build
