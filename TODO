must fix
========
- don't use rpkg, but use mock-scm's new feature for dist-git(s)
  https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/pull/41

best effort
===========
- `copr mock-config` generates configuration which doesn't include the parent
  configuration via "relative" pathname.  So even though we copy the system
  configuration into /results/configs, it still includes the /etc/mock/<id>.cfg

features
========
- when one `copr-builder` script is already running, instead of failing
  immediately on lock - it would be nice if we rather re-attached ourselves
  to the live-log provided by the running script

- copy the $opt_config file into /results/configs/copr-builder.conf, for
  reproducibility
